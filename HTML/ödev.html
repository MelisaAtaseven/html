     Align To One Axis
</font></h1>
      
<font face=Arial size=4>
       Build your type along one primary axis, and aling elements to 
       this grid line. For a vertical axis,align the left edge of your type.
       This will work regardless of font type or size. For horizontal axis,
       aling on strongest horizontal element.Sometimes this is the 
       cap height while others it's the baseline.</font>
